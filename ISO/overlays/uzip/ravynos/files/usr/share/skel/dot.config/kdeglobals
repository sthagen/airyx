# Note: This file gets used by the kwin if the 'library' key
# in the '[org.kde.kdecoration2]' section of kwinrc is empty
# and hence the default window decorations (Breeze) are used.
# It gets reloaded automatically when the file is saved.
# kwin does not need to be restarted for it to take effect.
# Seemingly it works only when placed in
# ~/.config/kdeglobals but not in
# /usr/local/etc/xdg/kdeglobals, even though it is
# accessed there.
# Seemingly comments with ; are not working here.
# Breeze can be configured in breezerc.
