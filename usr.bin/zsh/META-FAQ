the members of the zsh-workers mailing list <zsh-workers@zsh.org>.
The development is currently coordinated by Peter Stephenson
<pws@zsh.org>.  The coordinator can be contacted at
<coordinator@zsh.org>, but matters relating to the code should
generally go to the mailing list.

The Zsh FAQ

Peter Stephenson <pws@zsh.org>.  It is regularly posted to the
newsgroup comp.unix.shell and the zsh-announce mailing list.
The latest version can be found at any of the Zsh FTP sites, or at
https://www.zsh.org/FAQ/.  The contact address for FAQ-related matters

The Zsh Userguide
-----------------

A userguide is currently in preparation.  It is intended to complement the
manual, with explanations and hints on issues where the manual can be
cabbalistic, hierographic, or downright mystifying (for example, the word
`hierographic' does not exist).  It can be viewed in its current state at
https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/.  At the time of writing, chapters
dealing with startup files and their contents and the new completion system
were essentially complete.
