### Don't you speak English? Read this in: [Italian](README.IT.md) 

Airyx is a new open source OS project that aims to provide a similar experience and some compatibility with macOS on x86-64 sytems. It builds on the solid foundations of FreeBSD, existing open source packages in the same space, and new code to fill the gaps.

The main design goals are:
- Source compatibility with macOS applications (i.e. you could compile a Mac application on airyxOS and run it)
- Similar GUI metaphors and familiar UX (file manager, application launcher, top menu bar that reflects the open application, etc)
- Compatible with macOS folder layouts (/Library, /System, /Users, /Volumes, etc) and perhaps filesystems (HFS+, APFS) as well as fully supporting ZFS
- Self-contained applications in [App Bundles](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle), [AppDirs](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/AppDir), and [AppImage](https://github.com/AppImage) files - an installer-less experience for /Applications
- Mostly maintain compatibility with the FreeBSD base system and X11 - a standard Unix environment under the hood
- Compatible with Linux binaries via FreeBSD's Linux support
- Eventual compatibility with x86-64 macOS binaries (Mach-O) and libraries
- Pleasant to use, secure, stable, and performant

FreeBSD is an operating system used to power modern servers,
desktops, and embedded platforms. A large community has
continually developed it for more than thirty years. Its
advanced networking, security, and storage features have
made FreeBSD the platform of choice for many of the
busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking
and storage devices.
