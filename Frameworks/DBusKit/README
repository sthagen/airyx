ravynOS DBusKit is a very lightweight ObjC wrapper around libdbus.

Please note - this is NOT the DBusKit from GNUstep! If you are looking for
that one, you can find it at https://github.com/gnustep.

ravynOS's DBusKit is woefully incomplete, providing only the bare minimum of
functionality needed to support sending menus to the global menu bar. It might
support other things in the future, like proxy objects and XPC.
